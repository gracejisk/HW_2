"For" loop is the condensed version of the "while" loop. 
"While" loop is for continous looping. As long as the statement is true, it will continue to loop around.
The three parts of "for" loop are: given variable, condition, exit condition.
The term "nested" in context of nested loop means, to hold(nest) the "for" loop, meaning the outer loop will be in control
of the overall loop.
